        <h3>Coke Has a Brand-New Flavor, and It's Not What We Expected</h3>
        <p>Coca-Cola has made some controversial moves in its illustrious history. A few years ago, it discontinued Tab, the brand’s first diet soda, and despite a fan-led campaign to bring it back, it hasn’t been seen since 2020. And who could forget New Coke? The 1985 reformulation of the original Coke wasn’t a popular choice, so it didn’t take long for Coca-Cola to bring back the original.</p>
        <p>Coke is also continuously adding new varieties. In 2020 it debuted Coca-Cola Coffee and Sprite Ginger but discontinued both just two years later. Coke just dropped its newest limited-edition flavor, and we have no idea how long it will be around, but we do know this—it’s not what we expected.</p>
